# 🚗 Car Price Prediction

This project predicts the **selling price of cars** using **Machine Learning regression models**.  
It uses a dataset containing information about cars (year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine specs, etc.) and applies preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training to provide reliable predictions.

# 📈 Model Performance
 - The model achieved good accuracy with regression evaluation metrics (R² score and RMSE).
 - Performance may vary depending on dataset and selected features.

 # 📝 Future Improvements
 - Add more features (e.g., car brand, location, service history).
 - Deploy model as a web app (using Flask/Django or Streamlit).
 - Improve model tuning with advanced ML/DL techniques.
